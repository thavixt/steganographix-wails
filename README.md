## Notes about developing with Wails

- https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation

> If you are using latest Linux version (example: Ubuntu 24.04) and it is not supporting libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev, then you might encounter an issue in wails doctor: libwebkit not found. To resolve this issue you can install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev and during your build use the tag -tags webkit2_41.

### About

This was made with the official Wails React-TS template. More information about the project settings can be found
here: https://wails.io/docs/reference/project-config

### Live Development

```bash
wails dev -tags webkit2_41
```

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

### Building

[wails build - Documentation](https://wails.io/docs/reference/cli#build)

```bash
# wails build -tags webkit2_41

# -o          Output file name
# -clean      Cleans the build/bin directory
# -platform   Build for the given (comma delimited) platforms eg. windows/arm64. Note, if you do not give the architecture, runtime.GOARCH is used.
# -nsis       Generate NSIS installer for Windows

wails build -tags webkit2_41 -o Steganographix -clean -platform linux/amd64,windows/amd64 -nsis
```

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.

## TODO

- GitHub Action / CI
- testing (vitest / go test)
- better styling
